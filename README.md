# Customer Intent Detection System - Executive Summary

**Project:** Enhanced Intent Detection with Model Comparison  
**Date:** Analysis Results  
**Best Performance:** 91.77% Macro F1-Score (Naive Bayes)

---

## Problem Framing & Model Selection

### The Challenge
We addressed a **21-class text classification problem** for customer intent detection with a **severe class imbalance (3.78:1 ratio)**. Intent categories ranged from:

- **DISTRIBUTORS** (34 samples)  
- to **SIZE_CUSTOMIZATION** (9 samples)  

in the original **328-sample dataset**.

### Comprehensive Model Evaluation
We implemented and compared **9 different models** to determine the best approach:

- **Traditional ML:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM (Linear & RBF), Decision Tree  
- **Ensemble Methods:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors  
- **Combined Approach:** Ensemble of top 3 performers  

> **Key Finding:** Simpler models significantly outperformed complex ones.  
> **Naive Bayes** achieved both the **best performance** and **fastest training time**.

## Key Results & Performance Analysis

### Model Comparison Results

| Model              | Macro F1 | Training Time | Key Finding                         |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Naive Bayes**    | 91.77%   | 0.03s         | Best overall - deployed              |
| Logistic Regression | 91.15%  | 0.44s         | Strong second choice                 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors| 91.00%   | 0.04s         | Fast and effective                   |
| SVM (Linear)       | 90.78%   | 0.42s         | Solid performance                    |
| Random Forest      | 88.27%   | 4.40s         | Disappointing for complexity         |
| Gradient Boosting  | 86.61%   | 71.68s        | Worst time-performance ratio         |

### Data Balancing Impact
1. **Initial augmentation:** 328 → 634 samples (targeting 30 samples/class minimum)  
2. **SMOTE application:** 634 → 712 samples (final balanced dataset)  
3. **Result:** Improved minority class performance significantly

### Class-Level Performance

- **Perfect Classification (100% F1):** 11 out of 21 classes  
- **Strong Performance (>90% F1):** 5 additional classes  
- **Improvement Needed (<80% F1):**
  - PRODUCT_VARIANTS (71.4%)
  - DISTRIBUTORS (76.9%)
  - MATTRESS_COST (77.8%)

## Analysis & Strategic Insights

### Why Simple Models Won

The **2,389x speed advantage** of Naive Bayes over Gradient Boosting, combined with **5.16% better F1-score**, demonstrates that:

1. **Data quality trumps model complexity**  
   - Proper balancing (augmentation + SMOTE) had a greater impact than sophisticated algorithms  
2. **Feature representation matters**  
   - 1,081 **TF-IDF features** effectively captured intent patterns  
3. **Probabilistic models suit text**  
   - Naive Bayes’s independence assumption works well for bag-of-words

## Production Recommendations

### Immediate Deployment
- Naive Bayes model with `alpha=0.1` configuration  
- 91.61% accuracy **sufficient for automation with human fallback**  
- **Sub-second inference** enables real-time customer service

### Continuous Improvement Plan
1. Monitor and collect more examples for **low-performing classes**  
2. Implement **confidence thresholds** for human escalation  
3. **Retrain weekly** with new data (0.03s training enables this)

## Key Takeaway

This comprehensive model comparison validates that for intent detection with limited data, **careful preprocessing and simple models** outperform complex architectures.

> **The 91.77% macro F1-score** achieved proves production readiness while maintaining **interpretability and efficiency**.
